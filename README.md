# advent-of-code-2021

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/).
Advent of Code is an annual programming competition that takes place every December.
Beware that all code was written for a competition where the fastest submission netted the most points, so the code is messy in certain areas.
This is more so just to show my ability of solving complex problems quickly and does not resemble my ability to write clean and structured code.
I ranked 1st out of 119 participants on the leaderboard of my university, after already ranking 1st in the year before.
